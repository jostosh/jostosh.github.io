I really like working with neural networks because they are brain-inspired, they can be used for many different tasks and they can deal with high-dimensional inputs. The current momentum within the academic community on deep learning is so incredibly encouraging that I cannot resist reading and reimplementing papers from time to time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Capsule Networks","date":"November 23, 2017","description":"Neural networks with high-dimensional building blocks."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/capsnet/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/capsnet-cuda/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cuda, TensorFlow and capsule networks"}}}}
