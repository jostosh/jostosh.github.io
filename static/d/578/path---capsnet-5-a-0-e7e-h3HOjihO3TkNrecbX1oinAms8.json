I love working with on tensor-based models such as neural networks given the vast amount of applications, incredible performance, the room for new ideas and an immense community. The current momentum within the academic community on deep learning is so incredibly encouraging that I cannot resist reading and reimplementing papers from time to time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Capsule Networks","date":"November 23, 2017","description":"Neural networks with high-dimensional building blocks."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/capsnet/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/capsnet-cuda/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cuda, TensorFlow and capsule networks"}}}}
