As an exercise, I decided to take a shot at implementing a custom Op for one of the operations in capsule networks that would normally require some reshape hacking or at least a <a href=\"https://github.com/Sarasra/models/tree/master/research/capsules\">couple of intermediate TensorFlow Ops</a>. If you’re not familiar with Capsule Networks, have a look at the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829\">original paper</a> or my previous post. The open-sourced capsule network code by the authors can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Sarasra/models/tree/master/research/capsules\">here</a>. The code that we discuss in this blog post can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/jostosh/capsnet\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the concepts that are covered in this post (CUDA, TensorFlow custom Ops, gradient testing) can be learned by going through their corresponding documentations, but I always think it is enlightening to see how such separate elements come together. This is the main motivation behind my blog post: showcasing the development of a custom TensorFlow Op with CUDA from start to end. So let’s commence.</p>\n<p>EDIT There also exists a Chinese translation of this post by Jakukyo Friel.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cuda, TensorFlow and capsule networks","date":"February 11, 2018","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/capsnet/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/spn01/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tensorizing Sum-Product Networks"}}}}
