I believe this is due to several things. First, the daunting success of advanced deep neural networks like convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks overruled much of the alternative methods that may seem inferior at first sight. Second, SPNs are nontrivial to implement in a tensorized fashion (especially when compared to CNNs or RNNs). Third, SPNs come with a rich terminology and a strict probabilistic interpretation that might seem less intuitive then ‘cells that fire together wire together’. This series of posts aims at addressing these issues to varying extent by going through some basic intuitions behind SPNs, showing how to implement SPNs in a tensorized fashion and finally, looking at a hands-on example of SPNs for generative and discriminative learning on image datasets.</p>\n<p>Quite some time ago, I joined a project where we worked on a library with ‘tensorized’ implementations of SPNs, known as libspn. The library leverages the flexibility and power of TensorFlow to bring SPNs to the broader ML audience. Although by now it is something I need to pursue in my spare time, I like working on it since it sets some unique engineering challenges. I’ll explain the complexity of this challenge over the next few posts.</p>\n<p>This series of posts assumes basic knowledge of set theory, probability theory, neural networks and ‘tensor-based’ programming and computing.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tensorizing Sum-Product Networks","date":"June 11, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":null}}
