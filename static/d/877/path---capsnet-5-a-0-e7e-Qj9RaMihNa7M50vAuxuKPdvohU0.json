As an exercise, I decided to take a shot at implementing a custom Op for one of the operations in capsule networks that would normally require some reshape hacking or at least a couple of intermediate TensorFlow Ops. If you’re not familiar with Capsule Networks, have a look at the article or my previous post. The open-sourced capsule network code by the original authors can be found here. The code that we discuss in this blog post can be found here.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/capsnet/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/spn01/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tensorizing Sum-Product Networks"}},"next":null}}
