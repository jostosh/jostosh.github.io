I love working with on tensor-based models such as neural networks given the vast amount of applications, incredible performance, the room for new ideas and an immense community around it.</p>\n<h2>Capsule Networks</h2>\n<p>In this post I will be looking at an interesting paper that was recently made available <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829\">on Arxiv</a>. This paper is co-authored by Geoffrey Hinton, a leading expert in the field of neural networks and deep learning who is currently employed at Google, Toronto. His recent paper on capsule networks has made a serious impression on the community: #capsulenetworks Tweets .</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that this post assumes prior knowledge of TensorFlow and its most common operators. I should also add that it is really intended as supplementary material. There are quite some concepts and observations that I do not discuss here, but which you can easily acquaint by reading the article.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Capsule Networks","date":"November 23, 2017","description":"Neural networks with high-dimensional building blocks."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/capsnet/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/capsnet-cuda/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cuda, TensorFlow and capsule networks"}}}}
